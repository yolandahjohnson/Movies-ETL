# Movies-ETL
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to extract and take in new data, perform the appropriate transformations, and load (ETL) the data into existing tables. Movie data and movie ratings was obtained from Kaggle and Wiki. to be used to evaluate the success of movies. Code is refactored to create one function that takes in the three files — Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data — and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
- Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
